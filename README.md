# API-Project


A web application to show users concert venues around them, and display coming artists. Uses Google Maps API and Ticketmaster API to retrieve relevant information based on city inputted by the user.

Also give a simple chat form to connect with others looking for concerts or discussing artists.

This was a group project 4 people. I focused mainly on the Ticketmaster API adn connecting that to Google API. My other tasks was manipulation of data through local storage and Firebase.
